https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,"We could see that our data architecture was far too complex,” explained Nana Essuman, Senior Director of Data Engineering at Condé Nast."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,"It prevented collaboration and led to an overall mistrust of data across our data engineering, data science, and data warehouse teams. Even more significantly, it was preventing us from scaling to the degree that we needed as we prepared to become a truly global organization.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,"It was a very easy pitch to convince my VP that using dbt Cloud alongside Databricks Lakehouse was the right move for us,” recalled Essuman."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,"We could see how simple it was to integrate dbt into our other systems. And dbt had just launched dbt Cloud, which fit perfectly into our organizational strategy toward greater scalability.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,"With dbt and Databricks, our data scientists who build personalization models and churn models are finally using the same data sets that our marketers and analysts use for activation and business insights,” reported Essuman."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,This has dramatically increased our productivity while decreasing dependency on data engineers. It’s also much easier to monitor and control the costs of our entire data infrastructure because it’s all running on one platform.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,"During our data integration sprints in the past, a data warehouse engineer would have to build a data set, store it in S3, and then work with a data engineer to make that table available in Presto,” explained Essuman."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,Evergreen (Databricks and AWS) plus dbt Cloud has eliminated this work and is saving us 16 hours per project.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,"Now that we have an end-to-end view of our data models, we can catch problems before they reach a business user and we hear complaints,” concluded Essuman."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/cond%C3%A9-nast/,Condé Nast,These business users now have a much greater trust in the integrity of our data. None of this would have been possible without the solutions from dbt Labs and Databricks and the talent and hard work of our data engineering and data warehouse teams here at Condé Nast.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"A typical use case for our customers is to look at the data points in our software and wonder when and why their customers and prospects are dropping off their chat funnel,” said Brandon Smith, Director of Data and Analytics, Aktify."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"I knew if we used SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), everyone would be afraid to work with data in production because it would probably break something downstream,” Smith explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,We would probably have people complaining that we broke their favorite dashboard—and fixing these kinds of problems can be difficult and time-consuming. We didn’t want complex dependencies at Aktify. We wanted to ‘democratize’ our data.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"Data transformations are no longer a scary thing for Aktify,” Smith said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"From day one, we can let new employees loose on our data without wrapping a lot of red tape around their hands. With Databricks and dbt, we’ve been able to onboard employees into working with our data systems in half a day, compared to two weeks previously, and if they have some SQL experience, they’re usually comfortable with the systems in about three days. This wasn’t possible with any other system I’ve used in my career.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"With everything I have going on in Databricks and dbt, the time travel features in Delta Lake enable me to stop after making changes and see what actually changed,” Smith explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"If anomalies surface, I can go back and spot when I introduced the issue and why. That makes fixing the problem so much faster and easier.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"When colleagues come to me and ask for new tables, pipelines or extractions, I can crank them out in half a day,” reported Smith."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"It’s incredible how quickly I can engineer data pipelines with Databricks and then use dbt to model the data so it will surface the right metrics. Our stakeholders see new information they couldn’t access before and they’re making better decisions, whereas before they always complained that they were flying blind.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"dbt cuts out so many of the little tasks I used to have to do,” he said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"Without dbt, I would need at least two more people on my team. It’s saving us six figures per year by scaling the impact of the people we already have. If you’re still using SSIS, you’ll never meet your data needs because you can’t pivot fast enough and it’s too error-prone. dbt is a must-have tool.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"Other platforms may give you similar query speeds, but that’s not the deciding factor,” Smith said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"With Databricks, you can stand up new solutions much more quickly because the open-source tooling removes barriers. That’s the kind of speed that’s most important to us.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"We no longer stage data in Snowflake because all our data, including about 85 gigabytes of operational data, is instantly available in the Databricks Lakehouse,” Smith concluded."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/aktify/,Aktify,"Partner Connect also helps our team discover new data and AI solutions, bringing us closer to our vision of organization-wide data literacy.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/andela/,Andela,"In late 2019, we started talking about how we could get our talent matching product to market faster,” said Evan Johnson, Director of Data at Andela."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/andela/,Andela,We figured we could dramatically speed up our product development by building the data models in BigQuery using dbt and then prototyping the search functionality in Looker.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/andela/,Andela,"We needed to understand how different skills interacted with each other,” said Maya Neria, Senior Product Manager at Andela."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/andela/,Andela,"The difference between an engineer who knows React AND Python vs. React OR Python is big, and we didn’t appreciate this important nuance,” Evan said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/andela/,Andela,"If we hadn’t caught this during the early prototyping stage, it would just have created tech debt that needed to be fixed later on in the actual product,” said Maya."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/andela/,Andela,"Model the data in dbt, build the prototype in Looker, gather feedback, then build in MyAndela.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"As we’re growing, the number of sources is growing—the number of people relying on data is increasing… Today, we have around 32 sources of data, and 12 different teams utilize the data on top of our platform,” DC said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"We had an incident where our revenue numbers were skewed…and it was because we weren’t calculating data quality well,” DC said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"It was supposed to run on some schedule to try to detect anomalies in data…but when we ran it, [the monitors] completely overwhelmed our warehouse… Not only were queries taking a long time, but it was taking a lot of CPU on the Redshift cluster,” said Albert Pan, software engineer at Blend."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"Because a lot of the work in understanding data is within the product analytics team, we didn’t want to have data engineering be a roadblock,” said Albert."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"We wanted to give analysts a self-serve tool to be able to develop on, and dbt Cloud was exactly what we needed.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"A year ago, data discovery was the most important. We were asking, ‘what should we do with this data?’ Now we’ve reached a stage where data reliability is the most important,” DC said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,We want to calculate ROI for everything we invest in. The market has changed the strategy of how we reliably use the data. And that’s where Monte Carlo comes into the picture providing that insight in a very reliable way.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"It really started becoming a very automated workflow where we didn’t have to tune it or babysit it a lot,” Albert continued."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"Given that Blend is enterprise software handling data for large financial institutions, our data is a product,” said Noah Hall, product analyst at Blend."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"Without dbt, we just wouldn’t be able to live up to the kind of agreements we have in terms of providing customers visibility into their own data…or it would take many more months to actually get these products out the door.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"It’s never great when a customer tells you that something is wrong or missing. So, we wanted a proactive solution that could tell us when something is wrong, and we can fix it before they even know. That’s one of the main reasons why we use dbt and Monte Carlo.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"An application might use different microservices for different income verification integrations in the mortgage application process. So the foreign key out of one of those microservices that will allow you to join it back to the application ID might be stored in a JSON blob,” said Noah."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,We use dbt to modularize that different microservices data and extract some of those key pieces of information so that we can build out the clean end-user data into a table that will be queryable efficiently by our dashboarding tools.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"One of the things Monte Carlo offers is a very light way to [monitor data] by collecting metadata, which doesn’t impact warehouse performance on a significant level like our original POC project did,” said Albert."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/blend/,Blend,"At the infrastructure level, we’re going to focus on building real-time pipelines and a tracking framework… And on the other side, we also want to keep enhancing our products, which is the STP that we service our external users,” said DC."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"Our chief responsibility is helping all teams across the company use data to drive better decision-making,” said James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"That means organizing the data, providing dashboards and visualizations to our teams, and working hand-in-hand with our engineers so we have the data they need to drive the business forward.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,The amount of time it took to go from the inception of an idea to its implementation in our analytics was far too long.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"Our data lacked integrity and our team didn’t trust it– they were even skeptical of our raw data,” said James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,You can have the best data setup and fanciest dashboards but if people don’t trust the data then it’s all for nothing.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"Snowflake was ridiculously easy for us to set up. It took 2 hours, maybe less, for it to be ready to go.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"Snowflake was easy to use for any analytical use case and has every function under the sun. Load times of reports became near-instant, with at least 10x performance improvements.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"In some ways, it’s going slow to move fast,” shared James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"Before I joined and implemented dbt Cloud and Snowflake, it used to take ages to build data products because the data team was re-inventing the wheel with code each time. If you wanted to build a dashboard about auction sale rate, you’d need to copy and paste the same 50 lines of SQL and adjust it,” shared James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"With dbt, I can give someone access to the project; they can look through and see everything like metric definitions and lineage to see where every piece of data comes from and which reports it feeds.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,top of the Christmas tree.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"You will never be able to write a test suite that covers every eventuality, and there is nothing worse as a data professional than when bugs and erroneous source data slip through your controls and you’re one of the last to notice. It erodes trust in both the technical architecture and you as a data practitioner.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"Before anyone in the organization brings an issue to my attention, I know about it,” he said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"Thanks to Metaplane, I’m the one telling people, which puts me in the driver’s seat and fosters more trust.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/car-classic/,Car Classic,"I believe investing in the right tools to do the job is often better than hiring two full-time engineers to do the same thing,” concluded James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"When I arrived at Deputy, I was all excited,” said Sara Young, Senior Manager of Data Analytics."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Stakeholders would make requests that didn’t seem complicated, but it would take me so long. I couldn’t explain properly to the stakeholders that the data was such a mess.  It was making me and the data team look bad.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"All leadership had nothing but horror stories about working with the data team,” admitted Huss Afzal, Data Director."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"The VP of Customer Success shared that she asked for a dashboard that the data team said they couldn’t deliver for nine months, because that’s how long it would take them to build it.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Stakeholders knew the data team was not a good team. They weren’t surprised to be disappointed,” shared Sara."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,A lot of people started leaving. First it was the director of data left. And then just more things started breaking. Then we lost one of the lead data engineers and he left with little documentation behind… things just turned off.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Learning dbt was a small learning curve,” said Sara."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Analysts proficient in SQL can pick it up once they see how it works. Once you get your head around, the rest falls into place.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"You have one fact table and everyone is feeding off that table using the same metrics and getting consistent numbers,” said Andy Kwier, Lead Data Engineer."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Having that single source of truth grew confidence in the data. Today, if I run a report and you run a report, we get the same metric.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Freshness testing has helped a great deal to pick up on things straight away and get them fixed,” said Andy."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,We can now proactively flag and solve issues before anyone notices. This happened the other day with a table that was failing because of a null value that wasn’t allowed in the field.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Before, we had over 400 tasks running: streams and pipes going everywhere. We didn’t even know which ones were still being used for dashboards or reporting,” shared Andy."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,We saved 20% computing costs on Snowflake by cutting what we didn’t need.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Since we migrated to dbt, I haven’t had a problem that’s taken more than a couple of hours to fix. Before, it’d take a minimum of half a day,” said Andy."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,We had no lineage so you’d need to look into multiple pipes and streams. Now I can see what’s downstream or upstream.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"The pace of delivery has been phenomenal. Analysts are collaborating directly with the business,” said Huss."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"When you can answer questions almost immediately, then you’re invited by business stakeholders to join meetings and provide valuable insights on the spot.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"On average, I’d say dashboards that’d take months now take a week,” smiled Andy."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"The business feels very comfortable asking us quirky ad hoc questions, and because we have a model in place, it’s easy for us to either build it or answer that query,” shared Huss."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,Productivity is skyrocketing.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"Outside of that we also want to introduce some data science to some of our metrics,” said Huss."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,dbt’s integration with Python will come in handy there.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"With the metadata API, we’ll be able to understand which sources and which tests generally fail,” said Andy."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,This will give us more visibility into where our problems are.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,"This is something we’re building next year. We’re super excited about it,” said Huss."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/deputy/,Deputy,And dbt will play a big role in modeling that data and serving our new product.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"In my previous role an analyst would make a request, the request would drop into an engineer’s backlog, and three weeks later a new dimension would appear, often lacking any understanding of the original business context.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"To expect anyone new to understand the pipeline I had created, would have been tough. It was just this mysterious analytics server managed by me. I really needed a way to ensure consistency as the team grew.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"One of our core differentiators is how we leverage data to optimize and personalize an otherwise insanely complex and siloed healthcare system. Rapid, reliable, and accessible data is at the center of our ability to deliver value.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"Modeling in Looker alone wasn’t cutting it; it was hard to maintain, hard to test, and hard to extend models.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"I needed something that would enable us to spend more time delivering business insights than unwinding broken scripts, or investigating irregular dashboards.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,I really wasn’t able to test with the same rigor I was used to as a developer.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"dbt Cloud solves all those problems for me. It makes me feel like I’m spending more time delivering business insights than managing infrastructure, trying to pinpoint errors in formatting, or deciphering why a job failed.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"In the 12 months before dbt, when we were using our old analytics server/Crontab/Python setup, I created 4 models. In the ~2 months since launching dbt, we’ve created 15.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"Something that got me very excited about dbt was the concept of packages. Leveraging work from the open source community to work more efficiently with data sources like Salesforce and Segment helps me answer questions that are notoriously difficult for almost every organization. We used the Segment dbt package to create an attribution model that combines web sessions data with Google Ads and DialPad call logs. For the first time, we had a remarkably granular understanding of the true cost of customer acquisition.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,We ship every model with tests now. Prior to dbt… we didn’t even test our python transform scripts.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"With dbt we get tests built in which is very exciting. Before dbt I had a Crontab, a bunch of Jupyter notebooks running on a scheduler, Cronitor for monitoring, and a task in Snowflake to schedule SQL queries. It worked, but I really wasn’t able to test the way I needed to. Observability was near impossible without SSHing onto a server, and development was slow.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,Our Looker dashboards serve insights to more than 50 business users who access the system on a daily basis.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,Most dbt datasets ship with a short video to help data consumers understand how to perform and expand their analysis.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"dbt allows us to set, and track metrics-driven goals for almost everything we do. Every metric we track aligns to our core values, and is presented in that context to all business users.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,Our goal is to make the patient experience so easy and accessible that 100% of new members complete an appointment or health assessment with the team of professionals we match them to.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"We strive to reply to 100% of new patients requesting care in under 30 minutes, and all clinically urgent cases in under 15 minutes. dbt helps us create models we use to track and analyze these response times.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"Our Return to Work service enables employers to request daily health assessments directly through the platform. Employees reporting illness receive custom care plans within 30 minutes. Rapid response is crucial here, but quality of care can’t be overlooked. We use network utilization data to quickly source the right specialist, and match by proximity, price, availability, and quality of care.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,Routine testing in dbt gives us confidence that the provider we’ve selected and the care plan assigned is correct.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"Employers can check who is and isn’t ready to resume work, so they can plan backfill, or reach out to check that they’re ok.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/firefly/,Firefly,"dbt powers the dashboards we use to quickly compare our rates to national averages. Today, we can see we’re out-performing the market, but our goal is to reduce that metric by a further 20%. dbt will help us track progress.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"I can’t emphasize this enough,” James said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"We don’t have a dedicated database admin or anything like that on the team because with Snowflake, we just don’t need one.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"We often have times where we have a critical backfilling job. With Snowflake you can scale up for that one job, run the backfill, then scale right back down. Dynamic scaling with Snowflake is something that analysts can do on their own – no waiting for a data engineer.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"Even five years ago, data teams would have maybe one dev instance and one staging instance of their warehouse,” James said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,Snowflake is more like an ecosystem. You don’t even think of it as an instance because people can use cloning to spin up so many different databases.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"We’re pulling in data from our in-house databases, APIs, a lot of flat files sitting in S3, and Kafka streams. It all lands in our Snowflake data lake,” said James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"At any data organization in any company, you typically have a lot of analysts and fewer technical resources. This always creates a blocker to productivity. Whenever an analyst needs a new column or data grain, they have to go to a data engineer to get it,” James said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"We’re an organization of over 3,500 people. If we need to hire a data engineer for every 2-3 analysts, that’s just not going to be cost effective. It doesn’t scale.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"Even a little bit of copy/pasting makes maintenance difficult. If you need to change one line of code in a model, you need to find all the places where that code was copy/pasted.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,In some cases the data engineering team needed to write custom tooling to determine dependencies.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"Analysts were incentivized to have fewer models because the more complex the DAG is in Airflow, the more times you have to copy/paste the code,” James said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,An analyst would look back at a query after a week or month later and have no idea what it was all about.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"As an organization, we use the term ‘empowering’ a lot,” James said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"We have a highly autonomous company culture. We hire smart, trustworthy people and we want to make sure they have the tools they need to get their work done. That’s what we’re trying to do on our data team as well. We think empowering analysts to own their tools is the only way to build a productive analytics team at scale.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"We talk about guardrails vs. gates. We don’t want to put up gates for people, but we do want to provide guardrails. Guardrails are best practices that allow people to move quickly and confidently.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"dbt makes it easier to do data modeling the right way, and harder to do it the wrong way.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"In the past, most analysts on our team weren’t comfortable with incremental models. So they would either work with a data engineer or just do a full refresh every day.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"totally changing the way people write SQL,” James said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"HubSpot works with a lot of sales and marketing service providers. The classic example is a digital marketing agency who works with HubSpot to both sell the HubSpot product to a new small business and help them really get set up on HubSpot,” said Ashley Sherwood, the Senior Data Analyst on HubSpot’s partner team."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"Our partner channel is an important part of our business, which leads to us asking a lot of questions about the program.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"We’d been able to report on how many new sellers that we had, but never the attrition of sellers falling off. This led to us bringing a lot of pieces together for 2020 planning in a really exciting and new way.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"We have a legacy testing framework that works quite well for us. But being separate from dbt, it doesn’t make a lot of sense,” James said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,We’re currently adopting the dbt testing framework so analysts will be able to write their own data quality tests as well.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,"Most analysts learn SQL on a very small, simple SQL database. When you switch to a highly scalable, columnar database, it opens up new possibilities,” James said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/hubspot/,Hubspot,This is about education. We want to continue building an internal community around Snowflake and dbt to empower our analysts to get the most out of what these tools can do together.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Centralized data teams are often asked to be a catch-all for data related issues. We deal with infrastructure issues, business logic issues, data quality issues, and we have to be honest with ourselves that we create bottlenecks,” said Ben Singleton, Director of Data Science & Analytics at JetBlue."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"If we can let people take greater ownership of the data that they themselves are experts in, we’ll all be better off.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"My welcome to JetBlue involved a group of senior leaders making it clear that they were frustrated with the current state of data,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,It made it real to me on day one that there was a lot of work to be done. That was my call to action.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"I knew that we couldn’t just work on making our Microsoft SSIS pipelines incrementally better, or making configuration changes to our Microsoft parallel data warehouse to reduce our nightly eight hour maintenance window to six and a half hours. We needed to rebuild from the ground up.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Data engineers spend all of their time in data, but they’re not necessarily experts on how it’s used by different business functions to generate insights,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"The only way we can support JetBlue in becoming a data-driven organization is if more people can participate in the data transformation process. My data team can’t scale fast enough to meet the needs of the company. We need to enable a distributed model of data management,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"We don’t have much of a choice. Given the challenges we’re facing as an airline during an unprecedented global pandemic, we have to do more and be more efficient with less. Not only do we support regulatory reporting requirements, we need to enable critical decision-making that will ensure our recovery from this crisis. We can’t give up on or deprioritize data. We have to modernize, and we’re doing it quickly.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"I came to JetBlue knowing that introducing Snowflake and dbt would be the right game-changing move. I had bought into the vision that Tristan Handy and other folks in the dbt community articulated about modern data warehousing and the analytics engineering workflow. I still had to validate the technology and ensure it would meet JetBlue’s needs, but I trusted the approach.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Version controlled code ensures that changes can be implemented following audit-approved processes. This is a new workflow to most analysts, but they are often very willing to adopt new processes if it means gaining greater control over their data.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Airlines can succeed or fail based on how they respond in a snowstorm,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"JetBlue’s data infrastructure not only needs to help business leaders make long-term decisions, it needs to help crewmembers in system operations decide whether or not to keep the doors open an extra few minutes to accommodate a delayed connecting flight. These are high-pressure situations that require real-time data.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"People might think of dbt as a tool that only supports batch workflows which update a few times a day or once daily, but dbt can be used for any kind of data transformation in your warehouse, including real-time use cases,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Delays in operational data result in suboptimal decisions, and one suboptimal decision across a network of a thousand flights a day can disproportionally affect the customer experience and be expensive,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Traveling can be stressful, especially in the time of coronavirus. We want to be really smart about using data to improve that experience.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Previously, we monitored our data transformation jobs, but we didn’t actually monitor our data,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Missing data is inevitable, but the data team should be the first to catch it. Incorrect data is not only embarrassing, but can be costly. We frequently weren’t aware that something broke until our users told us.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"dbt makes testing part of the development process. It’s just part of the work you do every day, so it doesn’t feel like an extra burden,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Catching data quality issues before your users helps the culture of your team. No one likes to have fingers pointed at them. It’s an overlooked benefit of dbt–what it can do for morale,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Our availability hovered around 65%,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"In an age where people expect 99.9% uptime, 65% doesn’t remotely cut it anymore.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,We had to watch our Microsoft SSIS transformation pipelines and our APS warehouse jobs because they frequently and unexpectedly failed throughout the night.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"My hope is that by making our data really reliable and solid, we can get more people interested in asking questions of the data and getting their hands dirty,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"We want our Excel power users to be motivated to learn SQL, and our SQL users to get inside the warehouse and build data models. We want our decision-makers to feel comfortable building their own dashboards and getting answers for themselves without always having to rely on analysts, even to answer basic questions.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Our first group of 20 analysts have been trained on Snowflake and exposed to the data warehousing concepts guiding our approach, and the next step in the plan is to have interested data analysts trained on dbt Cloud.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"We need to approach data warehousing like any other product IT might develop. It needs to be intuitive, well-organized, and simple,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,No more abbreviations or acronyms.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"Documentation is important for newcomers, and also important for getting advanced analysts involved in the data transformation process.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,"We’ll be focused on building out our customer data models to provide enhanced ‘Customer 360’ insights. We have a fantastic loyalty program that we’re aggressively working to expand. My team is very excited to support those efforts through data,” Ben said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/jetblue/,Jetblue,So my team is working extremely hard to provide a world-class data stack and regain the trust of our analyst community. I’m confident it’s going to be a radical transformation. The new workflow with dbt and Snowflake isn’t a small improvement. It’s a complete redesign of our entire approach to data that will establish a new strategic foundation for analysts at JetBlue to build on.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"The key difference with Landbay is our marketplace funding model,” said Julian Cork, COO at Landbay."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"The marketplace has two sides, the lending and funding. Our vision is to be the go-to lender in this space and a default option for brokers, as well as the partner of choice for those that want to invest in buy-to-let mortgages.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"I had heard about dbt before,” said Chris Burrell, CTO at Landbay."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,And it was mentioned on nearly every customer reference call we did with Looker customers.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"Before we rolled out the new setup, we did a massive quality assurance check on every piece of our data transformation logic,” said Bruno Murino, Data Analyst at Landbay."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"We sat down with brokers, lenders, and product managers and asked: ‘What needs to be true at all times?’ And then we wrote dbt tests to catch those errors.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"If an engineer makes a semantic change, dbt tests catch that,” said Chris."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"And we stop the bad data from flowing into Looker: Looker users might see old data, but they’ll never see wrong data.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"Using a Glue Crawler we can automatically create tables with external data in Redshift, then we clean the data and join it on the postcode using dbt, and finally serve it up to end users in Looker.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"We have already incorporated land registry data, police data, fire brigade data and geographical data using that method.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"With dbt, we can empower users without technology team involvement, and the outcomes for the business are huge,” Julian said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/landbay/,Landbay,"All of our data–broker payment automation, sales order value reporting, broker performance, marketing campaigns–is served up by dbt and accessible in Looker. As a result, people feel empowered to get the best outcomes for Landbay.”"

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,"We’d gone from 0 to 1 on the analytics team. Now we were starting the journey to go from 1 to 100,” says Felippe."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,"The way we’d structured our data, our tables, our processes, everything was really starting to mount up.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,"At Loft we had a lot of different concepts that were referred to by the term ‘portfolio.’ For some in the business, it meant groups of listings. For others, it was the units themselves. And following from that, our own tables and reporting weren’t clear on this either.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,"We were not sure what models were being created, or if the same concepts were being used the same way in each model.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,"We were modeling data in Databricks notebooks directly; there was no review process and there was no version control,” Felippe said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,Everything in Looker was breaking once an hour. Everything would break when someone updated a table.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,"In the old version based on notebooks, we had a view with the definition of the table. We just ran CREATE TABLE AS and selected everything from that view. That used to take easily 45-50 minutes for each business domain, of which we had 6, all running a lot of resources in parallel. It was very intensive.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,dbt has made modeling accessible. Few folks on my team have deep knowledge of Python or software engineering. Business analysts can now model data themselves.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,"With the intelligence dbt brings to the table we know that if everyone needs this portfolio table, we can materialize it just once and then have all its dependencies run. Now, to run every model in production, our run times look like 50 minutes for everything in total without parallel executions. And we’re actually pretty confident we can reduce that much further.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/loft/,Loft,"Everything is plugged into Databricks. It all lives in one place and it’s all access controlled. We don’t have to worry about writing to a separate data warehouse or a separate cloud and pulling it into Looker. Having everyone in the same environment and accessing the same version of the same data, every time, is huge.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"In the first couple months I was just trying to wrap my head around what the business needed data to deliver on,” said Jessie."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"And in the back of my head I’m thinking, ‘It’s going to be a data warehouse. I hope it’s not a data warehouse, but of course it’s going to be a data warehouse’.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"Enabling more complex data science and machine learning work always requires an initial upfront investment in data warehousing and ETL, and I’ve seen this work take years,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"Data is considered a competitive advantage because it’s something that competitors in the space don’t do well right now,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"We wanted to deliver basic reports to our partners, with the ability to make data a core part of our long-term vision.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"I don’t want to be a database administrator. If I can avoid that, I’m going to,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,I wanted to build a modern data stack that was cloud-agnostic and gave us the flexibility to adopt the best tools now and in the future.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"Since business logic is stored in dbt, building reports directly on top of Snowflake data is easier for our clients as we’ve already done the heavy lifting, in terms of transformations, for them,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"In addition, dbt makes Tableau reporting easier for us because it allows us to reuse data sources across reports. We don’t have to recreate logic in each subsequent Tableau dashboard and hope it matches the same logic/calculated field used in the prior report.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"My first hires on the data team wanted to increase their technical knowledge and skill set,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,Just learning the software engineering process and applying that to analytics was a step in that direction for them.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,GUI-based ETL tools limit the amount of creativity and expression you can have. The analytics engineering workflow is just more interesting work than dragging and dropping something in an interface. I look for people who are excited about learning that new way of working.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"I didn’t want to hire a data scientist and make these wild promises that would all be data science work, they would need to do some reporting, at least to start. But I also didn’t want to hire data analysts whose sole job would be to just create Tableau dashboards forever.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,People are going to be able to wear a lot of different hats.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"I wanted them to understand that world a bit and what they were getting into,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,Data teams can lose trust with end users really quickly when there are bugs or mistakes.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"We explicitly require that every pull request is reviewed by two people, and the expectation is that you will get quite a lot of comments and questions. This is a powerful way to get feedback, learn, improve, and knowledge share,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"To me, it’s better to take the hit on velocity today if it means the quality of what we’re producing is improving over time.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"Very early on we looked at the SQL conventions from Fishtown Analytics, and then went through them and were like, ‘Well, this resonates with us, this doesn’t, or we would like to add this addition’.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"When someone is looking at the diffs of a code base, you want them to only  be looking at real changes, not formatting changes that adjusted one space.”"

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,But we haven’t gotten super complex yet.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"This isn’t anything new, it’s how every high-quality software project is run,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,You expect there to be tests. You expect there to be documentation. You expect the PR process to be collaborative. You’re building software together. We’re just applying this to analytics code as well.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"The thing we’ve got the most support and praise for is being able to deliver reports quickly,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,"Training is a core part of our industry. Our sales people deliver training, and then they want to come back and see who is actually using what they just covered,” Jessie said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mastery-logistics/,Mastery Logistics,Our internal reporting on product adoption has been really useful for them.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Every site, no matter what they’re mining, has to move payload. And they are going to want to see data showing how long it takes for a truck to be loaded in the pit, how quickly that material is transported out, how fast operators are completing a circuit, how safely drivers are taking their corners, and so on.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"The sheer scale of these projects means that any given analysis might be a couple of million to tens of millions of dollars of value for our clients,” added Richard Jones, MaxMine’s Head of Analytics and Support."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,That’s just the industry that we’re in.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"We’re dealing with mine sites all over the world, some of which are in very remote areas—the middle of the desert in remote Australia or across Africa,” said Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,So getting data from there up to the cloud is our first challenge.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"The automation is critical,” explained Richard."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,Nobody can game the system and it yields high-quality data.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"As an analyst, you would have to wrangle all of those files together by manually downloading them straight out of S3 buckets. Then, you would have to unpack and transform all of your different files to make sure that they were in the same format, time zone, and all that sort of nonsense.“Before dbt we did a lot of manual data manipulation,” said Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"You could do it, but it required manually downloading hundreds or even thousands of different files,” winced Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"We had a whole bunch of loose Python scripts that were just talking to S3 buckets, grabbing random files, and storing them on your local system. Maintaining them was a nightmare.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"There was an episode on dbt,” he said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,It was so impressive that I lobbied our executive team to get dbt Cloud and Snowflake.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Initially it was just a trial to see how effective the technology was,” continued Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,But as soon as they had it up and running the team all said ‘this is it!’ They loved it from day one.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"We’re now able to do analysis that used to take weeks in days,” said Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"It’s a very win-win set-up. If we’re able to perform analysis more quickly, it’s more efficient for us in terms of the people we need and it’s better for our clients because they get actionable insights, faster.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Previously we required someone with SQL skills, Python skills, and a suite of other coding experience to be able to handle even the simpler type of queries that we might get,” noted Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Now, so long as someone understands the fundamentals, they can very easily hop in and contribute. We’re able to get our support agents more easily involved in the actual analysis process, too.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Up until we had this set of tools, our analysts and support staff had PhDs in physics and engineering,” he said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Now we can hire graduates.“Before, we had to have conversations about how to use Python in creative ways to query our data lake. Now we don’t even talk about how to query the data—or we very rarely need to. It’s a change in kind rather than degree.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"We didn’t have the capability of using actual BI before,” said Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Now, we have a set of standard BI reports as well as custom BI reports as we create on a per client basis.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Some mine sites get paid on how many tons they move per hour. And ‘per hour’ can mean the number of hours that the equipment is running. However, if you’re in the 45°C - 113°F - desert, you prefer to stay in the cab and keep the air conditioning running rather than walking through the heat to a crib hut.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"Considering that the engines for these things are 16 cylinders, 2000 kilowatts, and four turbos—the kind of thing you use as backup generators for a small city—using them as air conditioners for one person is not very efficient.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"bigger and better,” laughed Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"There are two focus areas,” he continued."

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"dbt Cloud will become the key technology in stitching everything together so that our backend infrastructure is in one place and contributes to one central source of truth,” Theo explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/maxmine/,Maxmine,"As we onboard more clients, the importance of our analytics data store keeps growing. I don’t know what new use cases we’ll see, but I do know that I’m 100% confident my team has the data workflow they need to uncover impactful, cost-saving insights for every client,” said Theo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-nordics/,Mcdonald’S Nordics,"Denmark had a data warehouse alongside Tableau for reporting, Sweden was using an Oracle database with homemade applications, and so on.

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-nordics/,Mcdonald’S Nordics,"We needed these features, but we also needed to be more independent from the other tools we picked for our new stack, such as our new data warehouse and data visualization tool,” said Cristian."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-nordics/,Mcdonald’S Nordics,"We don’t know if we’ll keep these products forever, so we wanted to separate our models with dbt Cloud.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-nordics/,Mcdonald’S Nordics,"The data started getting messy, with strange transformations,” said Cristian."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-nordics/,Mcdonald’S Nordics,"We needed to have rules to coordinate the slowly-changing dimensions, and to do it in such a way where we could still reuse all transformations easily. We required a standard and that’s what Data Vault gave us,” Cristian explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-nordics/,Mcdonald’S Nordics,"We didn’t need to do a lot of investigation or setting new rules. The AutomateDV package handles the technical parts, with macros and materialization macros, creating the SQL,” explained Cristian."

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-nordics/,Mcdonald’S Nordics,"With the previous structure, we’d have to make many changes in the dimensions to get this data,” said Cristian."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-nordics/,Mcdonald’S Nordics,"But because we had all the historical changes and links in the Data Vault, we could quickly implement the changes. It was very satisfying how little time it took to deploy the new code.”"

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/monzo/,Monzo,"Sometimes it would be all the way at the source, which means we spent hours debugging an issue that was just poor data sent to us in the first place. dbt helps us enforce data integrity earlier in the pipeline which means we catch issues before they reach Looker.”"

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"SQL scripts were hard to maintain. When the person in charge of them would leave the company, we’d have no idea what was in there. And then we had to rewrite the code,” said Michael."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"It’s about the people you pick tools for,” explained Michael."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,And it’s hard to pick tools for sales people and executives.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"To me, self-service is not just necessarily about the capability of someone to get access to data, but how quickly you can give them the answer to something that they don’t have the answer to today,” shared Michael."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"I didn’t want to have to sit with each team member and guide them through a complex install as we brought in new analysts,” said Michael."

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"Most recently, we had performance issues with a model that does 15 to 20 billion messages per day. The dbt Labs services team helped us solve that.  The model took 45 minutes to an hour to run in a day, but they got it down to 10 minutes.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"I was very skeptical of improving collaboration through SQL, but it actually worked,” laughed Michael."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"Because of these dbt models, our sales and executive teams, can now see data points they never had access to before,” said Michael."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"For example, exchanges do pricing changes on a relatively monthly basis in the US. It has an impact on all types of different metrics you care about: your revenue, your volume, who’s trading with who, things like that.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"Before, our sales and executive teams would put a request into the economic research team or the data team. If they were lucky, it would be in a report somewhere or several reports, and maybe they could piece that answer together. Nine times out of 10, that was not true,” shared Michael."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/nasdaq/,Nasdaq,"By the time business users would receive what they requested, it might not even be relevant anymore. They could have missed a new business opportunity or lost revenue. Data velocity is important,” explained Michael."

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"At that point in time, it suited our needs, but as the business grew, we quickly hit the ceiling as new sources and new team members came in. As a result, we couldn’t scale our data sets effectively, and we started to lose a sense of lineage as the number of datasets blew out.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"We would start to lose track of how an upstream change would impact a downstream data set that would be exposed in Tableau,” said Sam."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,We would often have the same metric across various dashboards being different.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,Pepperstone works in an industry where price matters and price can change every millisecond. Small inaccuracies can blow up to very large reporting issues.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"Our business stakeholders lost confidence in our numbers,” said Sam, explaining that as a result, other teams within the organization tried to perform their own analytics without involving the data team—pulling numbers from older spreadsheets and potentially making decisions that weren’t backed by reliable data."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"That confidence is really hard to build…and it’s really easy to lose,“ he added.This lack of confidence had consequences across the team. It became harder, for example, to interrogate unexpected data when it appeared on a dashboard. Was an unusual data point a sign of something interesting buried in the numbers? Or was it the result of an inconsistency in the system?“It’s good to be surprised if your confidence in your model is high because that’s an insight,” explained Sam."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,It’s bad to be surprised if you have no confidence in your model…that’s just a search for the mistake.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"I realized dbt was good for us as soon as I saw the lineage,” he explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"It was easy to educate others because it was visual. You could just read it; you could actually see it.One of the team’s main goals in switching to dbt Cloud was to slash the number of inconsistencies in their reports, with an aim of limiting them to only a handful of cases each year. In addition, Sam and his team wanted to set up comprehensive test coverage of their most important reporting. Any mistakes needed to be caught before the reports are sent out - “it’s better for us to delay a report rather than send out an inaccurate one,” he noted."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"We get new data sources a lot of the time,” said Sam."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,We’ve been able to keep pace with the changes now because we have a really easy way to add or update documentation.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"We’ve got a growing team worldwide and needed a better way to onboard people,” said Sam."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"Before, we were very much at capacity.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"We’ve already managed to release company-wide documentation across our data sources, which we never had before,” said Sam."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"A lot of people had reached a bit of a ceiling in terms of what they were learning in regards to SQL,” Sam explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"It allows analysts to build macros and think a bit more programmatically in SQL, which has raised that ceiling.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"the increased speed gives analysts more time for insights and more time for discussion with stakeholders about the report that they’ve built, which should be the priority,” noted Sam."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,We aren’t just building a data set; we should be talking about it.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"It makes our life easier if we’re able to identify root data quality issues in sources and raise that visibility to the engineering team who can fix the root cause,” said Sam."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"Trust is so important because we are the experts in data analysis,” Sam explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"And if you have a good level of trust, your insights are more likely to be robustly discussed.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"So you have to be nimble, you have to be able to scale compliance, and you have to be able to handle many different requirements.“Working with dbt helps us achieve that,” explained Sam."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/pepperstone/,Pepperstone,"We’re going to run analytics on our dbt analytics, getting across more of the metadata reporting,” said Sam."

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/ramp/,Ramp,We can use dbt as a testing ground before fully committing ourselves to a new data product. dbt lets us abstract all of the nitty-gritty details that come with building data models so we can focus on delivering value to our business teams.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/ramp/,Ramp,"All of our models are born and bred in dbt. When people think of clean data, they think of dbt models. There’s very little that isn’t powered by dbt at Ramp,” emphasized Kevin."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/ramp/,Ramp,"Having enriched data available in Salesforce means the sales team has one view with everything they need to understand what’s going on in their pipeline,” said Kevin."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/ramp/,Ramp,"Thanks to Hightouch, we’re able to use Snowflake for all the heavy computations, allowing our production databases to focus on operations,” said Kevin."

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"Many clients don’t have the in-house marketing expertise to run sophisticated campaigns. It’s our job to help them drive customer growth over time, and we use data and AI to give them the best results possible.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"Today’s consumer expects to be able to complete the entire purchase process for most products online,” said Beidel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"But when they’re buying complex services, it’s challenging for businesses to get their message across effectively. Our goal is to create for our clients an optimal ad experience or many iterations of a website and then connect each of their customers with the user experience that will best help them understand the product. For us to tailor marketing to that level, we need to effectively use data and AI.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"Due to the nature of our business, we must maintain a separate data stack for each client,” Beidel explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"But Databricks, Fivetran and dbt help us avoid reinventing the wheel as we build out the processing, computation and data management pieces for each client. We’ve been able to take work our engineers have done and reuse it across multiple clients. We’ve also put Fivetran in the hands of our marketers to let them set up integrations for ingesting our clients’ data, and we’ve given them access to dbt to define data transformations. Because these tools are so simple, we often don’t need to involve our engineers.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"Databricks has allowed us not to have to think about managing infrastructure,” said Beidel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"For many workloads, we simply select the compute size, define our script and let it run. Our data engineers don’t have to be experts in managing Spark clusters. With Databricks, they can focus on the shape of the data and the business logic.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"Not having to manage clusters is a huge time-saver for us,” Beidel remarked."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,Our biggest grievance with other warehousing technologies is the lack of effective autoscaling. It’s a must-have capability when you’re working with a large volume of analytical workloads and have fluctuations in demand throughout the day. Having that variability in usage taken care of for us by Databricks probably saves one engineer out of 10.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"One of the things that drew me to dbt is that everything is in SQL,” Beidel explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"It serves as a common language for our team. Not everyone can write SQL, but everyone can read it and have a better understanding of what’s going on underneath.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/red-ventures/,Red Ventures,"Using the highly intuitive machine learning pipeline we’ve built, we’ve helped our clients increase cost efficiency in some channels by 20 to 30%,” Beidel concluded."

Snowflake made it simple to set up development, staging, and production databases so that the data engineers could easily move data from Postgres to Snowflake. After finishing the migration, it was immediately obvious how the separation of storage and compute allowed the data team to focus on helping their teammates answer questions about the business, rather than worrying about provisioning resources or storage costs.“It’s blown me away how quickly you go from getting by with some quick and dirty hacks to needing tools like Snowflake and dbt to break up and model datasets, manage testing, staging environments, deployment, all that stuff.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/reforge/,Reforge,Engineers can see how the data they model in dbt becomes data that other teams are acting on. They can understand why we make certain requests. It makes a world of difference in their motivation and satisfaction.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/reforge/,Reforge,"Because of Metaplane, I spook people with how quickly I find data issues now. I know when events are created with crappy names, when there are new attributes, when someone puts a unique ID in a segment event.

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"We were using LookML for all of our transformations, which just wasn’t scalable. There’s also a limit to what you can do—no testing, no DAG… it required tons of supervision to ensure alignment with existing architecture,” said Oscar Lukersmith, Lead Analytics Engineer at SafetyCulture."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"We had to manually build all the dependency graphs, and we ended up with our transformation layer sitting across two different tools. We were just adding more complexity to a system only a few folks had the skills to operate.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"From an internal data team perspective, it also meant we had to redo things all the time. We lacked reusability, which dragged out time to insights and affected morale.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"Half of dbt is the tool but the other half is the workflow it enables,” said Oscar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"We brought in an experienced Data Modeler to work closely with Oscar and the rest of the team to design the future state data model. And then we used that data model to rebuild our data,” explained Agnieszka."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"Internal data capabilities is the stuff under the waterline, where the work in dbt is setting us up for success. It’s often the things that the business doesn’t see because it’s below the waterline but they feel the impact,” said Agnieszka."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"The work we’ve done using dbt to improve our data model and data transformation approach has meant that people can actually trust the data. We’ve now got these component parts that we can reuse, and as a result, speed has really improved over time,” said Agnieszka."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"People love Tableau, and we’ve gotten some great feedback from our stakeholders in the business,” said Agnieszka—in particular calling out multi-use dashboards, an intuitive interface, and faster load times."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"Shifting into the dbt workflow was a huge shift. But 3-4 weeks in, you could see the moment when Analysts went from learning each component to seeing the big picture,” said Oscar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,Part of the benefit is from dbt itself. But then the other half is the workflow it enables.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"The team was part of creating the solution and it was really the Data Analysts and Data Engineers who drove the change. They created the human process together and are really advocates of dbt now,” said Oscar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"We’re branching beyond our initial safety focus and building a platform that empowers our customers to improve their operations management. To do that, we need to understand how customers manage safety and operations today and how our software enables them,” said Agnieszka."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"We’re using AI to better understand our customers, looking at about 150 different customer variables from demographics to product usage and behavior,” said Agnieszka."

https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"We built a scenario modeling tool that enabled us to model different pricing constructs across our whole customer base. What if the pricing model was like this? What would that mean for customer expansion? How would it impact our revenue? We combined that with research, working with Qualtrics to add voice of customer data into the model,” said Agnieszka."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"Underneath that, the whole model was built on dbt tables,” added Oscar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"We worked with GTM and Product teams to develop goals and built the Tableau dashboards that they use on a weekly basis to track performance and to take corrective action,” said Agnieszka."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/safetyculture/,Safetyculture,"Building the data underneath in dbt has enabled having a global unified approach to the way that we look at our data.

We were starting to lose trust and they weren’t going to use the reports. If they can’t use our data, that’s bad not only for our team but also for our business. Metaplane helped us get in front of those issues.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/spoton/,Spoton,"Metaplane is key to preserving trust in our data. You can spend all your time moving to this great modern stack, but if you lose people’s trust and they won’t use it, that work is for nothing.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"Data drives efficient growth. In order to grow correctly, maintain all of our inventory, retain employees, execute a very aggressive sales strategy, and report and forecast effectively, we need to have our data in order,” said Jared Stout, Head of Data Management at Sunrun."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"people didn’t know how we were building things,” explained James Sorensen, Senior Data Engineer."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"They didn’t know the code, they didn’t know the lineage, and they didn’t know how things were moving and transforming through our different stages of development.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"The number one reason why we switched from the open source offering to dbt Cloud was the ability to more meaningfully collaborate across data teams and with business stakeholders,” said Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"Sure, we could have paired dbt Core with Airflow to add things like testing and version control—for the small number of folks that have python and command line skills. Quality would be up, but we wouldn’t be moving fast enough for anyone to care. Instead, we have 40 analysts self-serving via the IDE, and business stakeholders answering their own questions with human-readable documentation.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"Us building out two complete data warehouses in two different platforms within a year and a half speaks volumes about the kind of velocity that dbt allowed us to achieve. Once the models were built out, moving them to a different platform was, for the most part, a pretty simple process…just porting over the code and making a few tweaks and syntactical changes that were necessary,” said Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"dbt Cloud enables all of the above by having a place where we can easily target code executions for only files edited. It keeps a history of the success or failure of jobs and more importantly, tests,” explained Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"We’re able to essentially create Git workflows and actions that check all of the Jira tickets to make sure they’re in compliance with requirements and run the dbt models in the database, making sure they succeed before we allow the tickets to be deployed and go out into production.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"Our deployment has sped up significantly—up to 75%,” said Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,We’ve become so dependent on the automation we’ve built and the ease of use that dbt Cloud offers that it’s hard to imagine ever going back to manual deployment.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"For me, the aha moment was when I realized the power of macros and how you could reproduce code automatically and dynamically generate SQL based on a macro that you defined,” recounted James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"I’d spend an entire afternoon hunting down a broken link in the chain somewhere and trying to figure out what was going on that caused a report error. It was up to me to iterate through the code, going from file to file, from view to table, and table to view back and forth to see the dependencies and lineage.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"Those types of questions come up all the time and they’re legitimate questions that should be answered,” said James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"So having dbt’s auto-documentation, having the ease of use of everything being in one spot, helps business units self-serve answers. If somebody has a question about whether something’s up to date, dbt makes it really quick and easy to just check the refresh jobs and make sure that everything is running as expected.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"The documentation and dbt status is really worth its weight in gold and saves everybody time,” emphasized Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"So far, we applied a standard set of tests across all of our models so nothing is built or delivered to stakeholders without having at least one level of testing on the table’s primary keys,” said Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"dbt tests add a ton of value with the clarity and quality they enable. As we talk to different business units and deploy dbt Cloud in their areas, they definitely see the vision there of ‘wow with one or two lines of code, I can make sure my data is quality before it even gets to the stakeholder’ which is huge,” emphasized Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"Defining our data in a centralized place will be a central line of discussion in our governance committee meetings where we discuss what data means, how it’s defined, how it’s calculated… all of these things are an opportunity to use dbt documentation as a discussion hub in finalizing those decisions,” said Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"Our vision is to be the centralized place to get data, and then other business units would be the users who take it the last mile. Using the same system, they can give their stakeholders the same type of data dictionaries and the same documentation from a dbt standpoint so everybody’s working on the same platform,” said Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"It’s a huge data set that’s critical to ensure our panels are efficient and provide value to the customer. And it’s up to the analysts on the team to work with the dataset’s unique complexities and model appropriately to generate useful insights,” explained Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"We set up half a dozen GitHub repositories by departments and we check on their activity every week: we’ll pull up Github and show them the trends on adoption and collaboration, and most business units are on an upwards trajectory,” said Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"We have 50 dbt Cloud user licenses right now, at 100% utilization, which speaks to how easy it’s been for analysts to ramp. dbt’s inline web interface is very good, and the IDE enables exactly what we need the business to do. They’re excited to get into dbt, and there’s a queue of non-senior analysts wanting access too,” said Jared."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"We’re in the process of building a dbt development community with regular meetings to share code, talk about techniques, and really build a cohesive place where people can share information and prevent developing in siloes,” said James."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/sunrun/,Sunrun,"There’s so much opportunity to improve, and we’re just getting started.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We provide a lot of recommendations in real-time,” explained Chong Sun, Senior Director of Engineering at Tempo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,Let’s say a user is working out—we can say: maybe you should increase your weight or adjust your form to be more productive and effective.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"In order for our primary marketing channel to be more effective, we need to understand where we should land users on our website and how we can optimize web pages,” Chong explained."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"From there, we can also accurately understand how much money we’re spending to attract each user.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"With our previous solution, we had a big pain point where the data modeling was not well structured.,” said Chong."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,There was no way for us  to maintain it and produce high-quality data with a small team.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"There were a few key components that we were previously lacking,” explained Eric Ganbat, Senior Analytics Engineer at Tempo."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"One was a way of testing data to make sure everything coming in is accurate. Second, we previously did not have a good way of doing version control, reviewing each other’s code, and establishing lineage.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We needed something that could clean, test, and transform data in Snowflake,” Eric said."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Our previous solution was not fit for us anymore,” Eric added."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We reached a state where we had multiple data engineers and analysts together as a team, and we knew it was time for us to think about how to organize, optimize, and ultimately build better data models. That’s when we discovered dbt Cloud.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"From my past experience at Uber, I knew how important a data catalog is to a data-driven culture,” said Chong."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We needed one place where we can easily identify which tables are servicing other tables. We also wanted to democratize data so everybody could access it, not just the data team, so the catalog was a central effort for us.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Growing from five to 300 people meant we needed to rethink how we would maintain consistent data, version control, testing, discoverability—all the capabilities that we could scale up with dbt Cloud and Stemma,” said Eric."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Once we set up development and production environments, made sure dbt Cloud was talking to Snowflake, and that credentials were set up correctly, everything was smooth sailing.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Stemma provided a huge value by helping us clearly understand what’s going on with the current table transformations and set up our migration plan and priorities,” said Chong."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,Without Stemma I’m not sure how we could have easily finished the migration.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Using dbt, we are now transforming all our data models with proper testing and documentation,” said Eric."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We’ve covered a wide range of data sets from different products, generating events through user activity; additionally, we have our financial subscription, product usage data models, as well as marketing and supply chain data.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We needed a solution to streamline our data from all sources, and dbt Cloud has truly offered that,” said Eric."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"It fits our needs in terms of data collection, understanding customer needs, and generating comprehensive reports and tables for internal stakeholders.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"The biggest thing that I noticed moving to dbt is the range of unit testing functionality. A lot of our supply chain data is pretty fragile in terms of the underlying data quality. In the past, stakeholders would reach out to us and we would have to address issues manually.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"The first week we launched dbt within a portion of the supply chain data, we caught some pretty glaring data quality issues that we could easily fix,” said Frank, “and we were able to resolve them before any stakeholder noticed on the downstream dashboards."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We’re able to work much quicker to respond to ad hoc requests now,” said Frank."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,That has been immediately obvious to our product analysts—we’re able to get more done in the same amount of time.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Now we’re able to change just one table or make one small transformation, and our changes will flow downstream,” added Chong."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"It’s hard to quantify, but I’d say it’s improved our efficiency by about 30 or 40 percent for certain data engineering tasks.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"None of our team members had extensive expertise in command lines. So it’s really helped us to work faster and elevate our team’s capabilities. dbt Cloud is able to quickly compile and run everything we need,” said Eric."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Eric and I have been able to review each other’s code in a way that we just weren’t doing beforehand. I went from not looking at anything to reviewing everything he touches,” explained Frank."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,It’s gone from 0 to 100. Collaboration has been a huge win for us.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Our orders table is particularly important because it tells us what products we’ve sold,” said Eric."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"That’s one of the key financial metrics the finance and marketing teams use, which in turn provide our growth metrics.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"The unified workout table is a big one,” added Frank."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Whenever we’re doing any sort of product testing or feature development, that’s the table that always gets referenced.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Stemma has been a very powerful tool for us to quickly identify work that needs to be done to address new requests. If we need to change a data field, Stemma helps look upstream to find dependencies and trace back to the source so we can make requests of engineering to rev data quickly,” said Chong “Lineage tracking also plays a role in avoiding breaking changes and understanding the downstream impacts of changing columns and tables."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"I’ve been using a column lineage quite often because column naming wasn’t consistent when we migrated. But with Stemma I can easily see when one column is derived from another column with a different name,” said Eric."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,It’s helping me go back and clean up names after the change.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Data table usage is another key feature of Stemma,” said Eric."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We had a case where we knew there were many tables not being frequently used. By looking at lineage and dashboard usage in Stemma, we were able to easily trim down about half of our tables that weren’t being frequently used.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We’re very happy with our current data setup,” said Chong."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Overall, we’re confident we have the right tech stack with dbt at the center, combined with Stemma and Snowflake. It satisfies all our current needs.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We are now able to build much better models. And by building better data models, we can bring more value to our products and to the business.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"We’re looking into a number of real-time use cases,” explained Chong."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Once we get the data from our client side, we can rapidly move that information into a data warehouse, another third-party service, or downstream where real-time decisions can be made.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tempo/,Tempo,"Tempo is not just a smart home gym. It is a data-driven platform that helps its customers reach their fitness potential, enhance their well-being, and have fun while working out. By improving the platform, we can improve the way we use our customer’s data to personalize their training, optimize their performance, motivate their progress, and connect them with others.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,"The data team became a bottleneck,” said Kumar Aman, Team Lead Data Engineer at TIER Mobility."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,We needed everyone to effectively contribute and develop.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,"dbt abstracts most of the underlying data, such as creating and dropping tables, defining data types, and version controlling code,” explained Kumar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,The data practitioner doesn’t need to know the intricacies of the underlying data to use a table. Our analytics team can go straight to building scalable models on top of the existing infrastructure.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,"We started with Redshift, but two years later, Snowflake was a better fit for our scaling data needs,” said Kumar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,"Through demand prediction we operate in a much more efficient manner, unlocking profits of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars,” emphasized Kumar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,"Fleet data backs our decisions on safety processes,” explained Kumar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,"It informs us if users are parking their e-scooters and e-bikes in the designated, compliant spots.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,"dbt is the heart of our data stack. It all begins with centralizing and defining models and metrics in dbt. From there, our platform team can push the data to a variety of tools to facilitate their work.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/tier-mobility/,Tier Mobility,"TIER started out strong on the modern data stack, and we plan to stay at the forefront of these technologies to drive our competitive advantage in the market,” concluded Kumar."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"With data, you get a really good health profile of the member before they even sign up,” said Trenton Huey, Senior Director of Data at Vida Health."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,It helps us personalize their onboarding and identify the right programs for them.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"The data is not just used for reporting and analytics, but also to directly guide the end-user experience in our application,” said Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"Non-engineering teams were struggling to get anything done,” shared Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"We have opened new lines of collaboration by using dbt and Fivetran,” said Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,Fivetran’s reputation spoke for itself. We knew it could move our large—and growing—volumes of data from all of our sources securely. We didn’t even evaluate other solutions.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,The fact that claims data stored as flat files in GCS could be moved was the clincher. Everyone from data engineers to analysts was bought into Fivetran.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"We could cut thousands of lines of code,” said Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"At my last company, we needed several Spark jobs to transform data. With dbt, we need far fewer resources to do the same work.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"dbt has enabled things that were just not happening at all before. It’s like zero to one on certain things,” said Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"Analysis on the treatment of a certain condition used to take months, even quarters. And after that was ready, we’d still have to wait months until those insights were fed into the product,” said Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"Now we get access to the data faster with Fivetran and build the logic directly on dbt, so we’ve reduced that time from quarters to weeks or, sometimes, days.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"having access to pipeline creation and monitoring (with alerting) all in one place with Fivetran is helpful. We can easily pinpoint issues with data ingestion as they come up,” said Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"We also appreciate having fully managed connectors with schema migration and automation built in, for all data sources that power our technology.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"We have CI/CD testing on all pipelines—that didn’t exist for many of our pipelines in the past,” said Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"Now we have much more precision on what we’re creating,” emphasized Trenton."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vida-health/,Vida Health,"We can trace issues down. Before, we had issues where it took two weeks to find out what was wrong; now we have an answer within a day.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vivian-health/,Vivian Health,"The ability to load sample data into dbt allows us to verify our models work as intended before deployment,” said Max."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vivian-health/,Vivian Health,"we want to use the Python functionality more. It’s already given us results,” said Max."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vivian-health/,Vivian Health,"Everyone on the team knows how to create a dbt model, and with only 2 data engineers that traditionally were responsible for modeling, that’s pretty cool. I can make a new dbt model as fast as it takes me to write a SQL query. It’s so much faster than how we did things in my previous roles. I could not go back, ever,” emphasized Max."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vivian-health/,Vivian Health,"If I get a Metaplane alert, it’s always something that’s gone wrong, which is what we want. We want to ensure that we’re catching everything without over-alerting,” said Max."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vivian-health/,Vivian Health,"We’ve been using Metaplane for at least a year and a half…I’ve seen the many improvements that Metaplane’s made. It’s pretty cool to talk directly to developers and 90% of the time, when I bring up a feature, it’s either being worked on, or, they’ll just tell me: ‘Oh we fixed that already. I’ll turn it on for you now’.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vivian-health/,Vivian Health,"We had an OKR last quarter related to data quality that Metaplane helped us achieve,” said Max."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/vivian-health/,Vivian Health,"dbt is a critical part of our infrastructure, and Metaplane allows us to ensure that it is running smoothly around the clock,” Max concluded."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/wellthy/,Wellthy,"There’s nothing more stressful than caring for a loved one. We need to be able to provide personalized support when and where they need it. Being armed with this information ahead of time makes for a better member experience,” said Kelly Nelson Pook, Sr."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/wellthy/,Wellthy,"We’re trying to position ourselves to serve as many people as possible with the best caregiving assistance possible, and Snowflake powers everything we do from analytics, to operations, to activation,” explained Kelly."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/wellthy/,Wellthy,"Previously, data teams would try to shove all of their transformation logic into one gigantic query. dbt Cloud lets us modularize the different stages of our transformation layers, standardize everything with version control, and easily use DAG visualizations to see how our models relate to one another,” added Kelly."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/wellthy/,Wellthy,"We have a ton of dbt jobs and tests running at all times, and we need to be able to identify potential problems without canceling or stopping our data flows. Hightouch lets us proactively send alerts to Slack so our Care Team can take action immediately.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/wellthy/,Wellthy,"I’ve been working in the data space for over ten years, and Snowflake, dbt Cloud, and Hightouch have solved 95% of the problems that I’ve run into. Together, these tools power everything we do at Wellthy.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"Our previous stack of AWS Glue, EMR, Kinesis, Athena, and Airflow required knowledge of complex frameworks & languages,” said Emmanuel Fuentes, Head of Machine Learning & Data Platforms."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"In order to scale, we needed a consistent end-to-end approach.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"I looked for tools that would allow us to act as if we were 10x size,” said Emmanuel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,I wanted us to all use common features to be aligned on how calculations are made.”
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"We could have the same setup with Airflow DAGs. But I’d need a bigger, more specialized team and our maintenance costs would be 10 or 20 times higher,” he emphasized."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"Analysts, engineers, and machine learning are all working on similar problems. When teams use common data models, that enables a lot of efficiency,” said Emmanuel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"Someone might have built something for an analytics report that gave an idea to a machine learning person. Instead of having to rebuild it from scratch, they can reference their dbt model and then move on.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"This new workflow decreased the delta between an idea and publishing to production by a fourth or eighth,” said Emmanuel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"We’ve gained a lot of efficiencies because we use SQL across our models, transformation layer, analysis, and dashboards.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"When you’re growing in a tight hiring market, you need really smart people that can scale very quickly,” said Emmanuel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"A lot more people know SQL than languages like Scala. A SQL-first approach to data pipelines, transformations, QA, and analysis is essential.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"We can skip redoing this layer that people get stuck in—like dimensional modeling, Kimball models or Snowflake schemas—and go straight to business value,” said Emmanuel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"With our new stack, it takes new analytics engineering hires just one week to learn our stack. They read the docs, open up the dbt DAG, explore our data in Hex, and are ready to push code to production.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"Because each business is so different—sneakers, vintage clothing, Pokemon cards, food and beverage—they all have different data assets being generated,” said Emmanuel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"That results in thousands of fields that we need to be constantly computing and articulating to stakeholders. As you go wide, that data diversity only grows.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"dbt and Hex make the data development environment so much easier to work with than any other combination of tools. Since it’s all native, we don’t need to wait for or build a custom adapter,” said Emmanuel."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/whatnot/,Whatnot,"I can instead focus on scaling my team, and building the best live shopping platform.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/yummy/,Yummy,"Our rapid growth and diversification are why it’s so important yet uniquely difficult for us to create a single source of truth for our data,” said Luis Noguera, Head of Analytics."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/yummy/,Yummy,"As we scale the data team and the organization, our data infrastructure has to be scalable, self-service, and trusted by the entire organization.”"
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/yummy/,Yummy,"Analysts were often repeating models that had already been built for different use cases,” resulting in tangled data made of single-use tables."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/yummy/,Yummy,"The fact that we could implement dbt as a new data team was exciting. We had a lot of work to do, but there was so much potential for building our foundations with dbt. I think every new team should start out using it. The earlier the better,” said Luis."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/yummy/,Yummy,"The hardest part was understanding data modeling. But seeing the DAG for the first time was when things clicked. We didn’t have that visibility with our scheduled queries,” said Luis."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/yummy/,Yummy,"Before, we were building for now, or for the next hour. But by taking a little bit longer in the moment, we’ll reap the rewards of velocity in the future,” said Luis."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/yummy/,Yummy,"Analysts could do demo runs before pushing anything into production, which they couldn’t do before. dbt lets them get hands-on without messing anything up, and I think that’s what made our 3-month implementation so fast. Having a safe playground to develop and test was essential,” said Luis."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/yummy/,Yummy,"We were growing so fast that breaking things seemed unavoidable. As a result, we had business users answering business questions with in-app events-based data instead of data coming from documented and well-maintained tables,” said Luis."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/zip/,Zip,"Cost scalability is a key consideration for us. We’ve been burnt before with event volumes so we went into cost scalability with eyes wide open,” said Moss Pauly, Sr."
https://www.getdbt.com/success-stories/zip/,Zip,"Recently, our CIO wanted to query Twilio data and pinged me about the Twilio table structure while I was getting coffee.
